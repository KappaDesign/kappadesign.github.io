I finally finished the hakkero, at least to the point that I'm happy to call it
finished.

I ended up changing a few things about the design: I used additional cut Acrylic
pieces in place of the filled engraving, mainly this was because the particular
laser cutter I was using does not like doing anything more complicated than
vector lines. However I thing this alternative ended up looking much better
anyway.

After much buggering about trying the vacuum form some reflective HIPS for the
LED mount I ended up using one made out of white HIPS. I think the reason the
mirrored HIPS failed was a combination of the reflective surface or the fact
that both vacuum forming machines I used had dodgy seals.

The photo above shows the two halves of the hakkero just before final assembly.

The LED's are a strip of NeoPixel compatible LED's (I can't remember the part
number and can't seem to find where I bought them) controlled by an Arduino UNO
clone, eventually I plan to have several lighting modes controlled by the
switches on the back panel and the option to control it over MIDI.

At the moment all I've done is upload my [NeoPixel
lighting](https://github.com/DanNixon/NeoPixelLighting) firmware until I get the
rest of the code written (mainly getting
[Luna](https://github.com/DanNixon/Luna) finished).

I've made a little more progress on the Hakkero!

I now have a full set of CAD drawings that prove that the thing should work when
I put it together, hopefully this should look something like this:

Here all the wooden (red and brown in the diagram) parts will be 3mm birch
plywood (actually quite a bit lighter then the colours used in the diagrams),
the silver pats ill be cast pewter and the clear blue is some kind of frosted
Acrylic.

I was originally going to use some of the Adafruit NeoPixel LED rings to back
light the front of he Hakkero through the frosted Acrylic, however even the
largest 24 LED module was far too small for this. Instead I'm going to use two
rings created from the long strips of NeoPixels (or NeoPixel compatible devices)
around the inside of the inclosue and a reflector to point the light towards the
frosted Acrylic.

The reflector and LED rings can kind of be seen in the exploded diagram below:

I've done more or less all the work I can on this for now until I can get back
to the workshop to actually make this, which should be just over a couple of
weeks now.

Hello!

I started this for two reasons:

- I have many ideas for some more serious "art" and cosplay projects that will
  hopefully come to fruition over the next year or so.
- I reaslise no one actually sees anythoing I do when all I every do is shove it
  on a Git repo and forget about it (I do have my code/engineering blog, but I
  may as well keep that for code & engineering).

So, I have a couple of smaller projects on the way that should be done shortly,
but the majority of the larger projects are likely going to have to wait until
I'm back in Newcastle.

Until then, please wait warmly.

(p.s. thank you [David  Easton](http://davideaston.me.uk) for graphics âˆž% better
than what I could have ever done)
